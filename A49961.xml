         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And another find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95688:14"/>favour in the eyes of the great King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was the occaſion of delivering the <hi>Jews</hi> from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in 127 Provinces; and the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Kingdoms Chronicles opened a door to <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Glory and <hi>Haman</hi>'s Infamy. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> arrived to unexpected Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by expoſition of Princes Dreams, whereby the Church of God was ſtrangely preſerved, and at length delivered from Exile. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> coming into the Temple, at an inſtant of Providence met with the Lords Anointed, and ſaw his Salvation. Many of the choiceſt Mercies fall under this head. The firſt and primary Mercy to the World, the <hi>Protevangelium,</hi> the preaching of the Goſpel to <hi>Adam</hi> by God himſelf, tranſcended the thoughts and imaginations of our fallen Parents. The ſending of the Meſſiah's Sceptre out of <hi>Zion</hi> among the Gentile Idolaters, who ſought him not; and the Converſion of whole Nations to the Obedience of his Spiritual Law, was performed by preventing Grace to the whole

More admirable the ſafe fall of a Butcher upon his Sheep from the Cliff at <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, as the Inhabitants report. How did an impulſe upon Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> Spirit to viſit a Friend two miles off in the night, prevent the Self-murder of that perſon by a Halter, who was eſteemed truly gracious, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by direful tentations?

Some by Falls into Rivers have been cured of Madneſs; others by ſudden frights reſtored to the uſe of their Limbs; and others by Shipwreck have eſcaped Piracy. And (which is diſtinct as to relief unexpected in deep poverty) that of <hi>Acceſilaus</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, who cauſed a Bag of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be conveyed under the pillow of a ſick Friend, modeſtly hiding his poverty, that he might find it rather then receive it. And others that have let fall Money into the laps of perſons from a window, as if it fell from Heaven.</p>

               <p>THE glittering Stars of Heaven, the drops of the briny Ocean, and the Sands upon the winding Shores, the Duſts of the Earth, and the Atoms that ſwim in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, are not ſo numerous as theſe excellent Mercies. <hi>Archimedes</hi> could write a Treatiſe of the Sands, but no perſon that ever appeared on the ſtage of Being, though he ſhould ſpend all his time in writing Volumes of his own Life, could trace the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his Mercies, were he never ſo obſervant, or did pry never ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly into the paſſages of Divine Providence. Every draught of Air into the Lungs is attended with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. When it carries out the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Vapours of the Heart, who can attract it in again for the refrigerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bloud, and mixing the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile

               <p>It's impoſſible to follow the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of theſe mercies: Heaven it ſelf is not ſufficient for a finite capacity to meaſure them.

               <p>As to the firſt, When we riſe in the morning, that ſudden palſies do not unlooſe our Nervs, or painful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95688:17"/>Convulſions ſhrink them up; that we are not able to deſcend our Stairs; that when we are down, ſome Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Death doth not appale us with terrible tidings, and give us a bitter breakfaſt; that we have Hearts and Spirits to call upon the God of our mercies in our Families, as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt the evils of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. When we come into our Shops, that the rapines of night Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies hath not ſtript us naked of all our Goods, and that we find all our Relations in health and peace when we walk abroad; that we ſuck not in Contagious Atomes from the Air; that the Eaſt wind does not blaſt us; that ſudden violent rains in haſty walking do not cool our ſweats in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Surfets, or that we hurry not the blood into fermentations for new and ſurprizing diſtempers. In vain ſhould we be wary, if holy providence were not wakeful. That the earth we tread on doth not ſuddenly open its mouth to ſwallow us as it did the Rebels in <hi>Numbers.</hi>

We ought to be thankful that Coachmens whips do not accidentally ſcourge out our eyes. That in the days of general Trainings or publick Shows ſtrange diſaſters brings us not to the evenings of our lives. That meddling with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning quarre's in the ring of a tumult, twiſt us not into danger

That we ſink not into unfenced Gravel-pits overwhelmed with quick-ſands, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown with waters. That Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings do not lick up our ſpirits, or hot Thunderbolts rend us in ſunder. We ſhould reckon our mercies not by miles or hours, but by ſteps and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When we come to our meals that fitting refreſhes, when many by painful Fiſtula's pine away into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and cannot repoſe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into any grateful poſture. That we bring appetites to our Tables, and are not by cares and vexations from abroad rendred ſnappiſh and curriſh to a tender Wife and ſweet obedient Children at home, and our ſtomachs ſtuft with choler, unfit to crave a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receive it.

That any one of theſe curious Viands meet not with an ill-habited Scurvy in the blood, and eſpecially all confuſed together carry not thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands from the Table to the Pillow, and thence to the chambers of death.</p>
               <p>When at our meals what a mercy that every bit doth not ſtrangle us, ſince ſtory remembers ſome to have received their laſt by a raiſin ſtone, a fly, a hair. When our dayly food paſſing over the Larynx, the bridge that covers the windpipe, that it doth not choke us, as the rump of a Capon did the Earl of <hi>Colrain.</hi> When after

That when we have eat and drunk, that we can render our urine and uncover our feet, thouſands pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by ſtopping the chanels of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Let's daily bleſs the Lord for Evacuations as well as Ingeſtion. It's wonderful that mens cutting their Hair tends not by diſtillations on the Lungs to Conſumption, or by letting bloud that an Artery be not cut, as ſome who have loſt their Arms. Or ſo inconſiderable a thing as the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Corn does not rankle to death, as in the Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi>

               <p>When we converſe that Pride and Paſſion do not entangle us, or Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Suſpicious tempers do not wreſt us to diſpleaſe or diſtruſt our

               <p>That ſudden Noiſe and Alarms of the night do not fright us to awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo hurtful to the Animal ſpirits. That we can ſleep quietly,<note place="margin">

               <p>Of the innumerable evils theſe are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95688:20"/>ſome few touches, and the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercies that inſtead thereof we enjoy. O that man would learn to praiſe him for his wonderful works to the children of men!<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Let's treat a little of the ſecond, he prevention of evils by afflictions, both the evil of ſin and danger. As to ſin, we ought to preſent God as a Father in afflictions.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.16.</note> An uncorrected child brings his parents to ſhame. We ſhould ſhame Religion and our holy Profeſſion, if God did not often hedge up our ways with thorns, that we may ſearch out the paths of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6.</note> It's a ſweet argument of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love. We weed the Gardens wherein we delight to walk, file off the ruſt of uſeful Inſtruments and refine the rugged Oar by the fire, and purge our own bodies from that feculency in the bowels, that might produce obſtructions. We loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but droſs and corruption in the fire. Our Spiritual Phyſician lets out nothing but impure bloud by his Phlebotomy. Nay ſometimes God prevents ſin by ſin, preſerves from fouler ſins by leſſer falls; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95688:21"/>it proves very profitable to ſome proud and preſumptuous ſpirits to ſtumble into ſin, thereby receiving a check to their haughty, ſtomachful, and cenſorious tempers. Such trials and afflictions imbitter ſinful courſes. We are dangerouſly addicted to preſent enjoyments, and to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the arm of fleſh, and value the vanities of this Life. Sanctified afflictions drive us from the World to God, teach us to live by Faith, warm the Spirit in prayer, and whets prayer into crying, as it did to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> We uſually ſend up faint pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in times of proſperity, when Halcyon calms are upon our Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. In ſtormy times we fly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Rock, and mourn like holy doves in the clefts of the Mountains: we are more mortified to the World, weaned from troubleſom and peeviſh Relations, reliſh ſpiritual motions, and have a ſweet ſavour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes upon the Souls palat, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt Death, and prepared for the Kingdom. We learn to bleſs God for croſſes, who makes the worſt of a Chriſtian to work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95688:21"/>for the beſt of a Kingdom. We learn to make peace, not ſo much with the Inſtruments as God the principal cauſe. For affliction cometh not out of the duſt, but drops down from Heaven; and therefore piouſly turn the eye and the heart to him that ſmiteth. Not to fight with the Rod, or bite at the Stone, as carnal perſons; but to be very humble and ſeriouſly penitent like <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who chattered like a Crane under his ſorrows, but went ſoftly, (as in Sackcloth and Aſhes) all his days; and (like <hi>David</hi>) not onely pray for preſent pardon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.10.</note> but for a free ſpirit to walk holily in time to come. No falſe heart can truly deſire prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, as the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after cleanſing and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mercy begs eſtabliſhing grace. That repentance in ſickneſs is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, ſincere, which hungers after grace more truly then it hankers after recovery, knowing that the end of the Rods diſcipline is then accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as to danger both tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal, What's the Life
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95688:22"/>of Man but a Sea of dangers? what's the Mercy of God but the haven of deliverance? Every affliction ſhould be a Memorial of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and teach men to call their ways to account, and eſteem all to be mercy ſo he ſave us at laſt. Many by ſin bring the affliction in kind, ſhorten their own days, cut off the thread with their own Knives, and put out the candle of Life with their own Extinguiſhers. God ſanctifies the approches of ſuch bitter dangers to a ſight of corruption, and to ſaving repentance before the dying hour, to ſuch as are elect according to the purpoſe of grace. Good men may be judged of the Lord; may drink of bitter cups,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</note> as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ſick, and weak, and ſlept, for unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving; that they might not be condemned and periſh with the world. We muſt learn to juſtifie God, yea to praiſe him here for affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for which hereafter we ſhall fully glorifie him. Our troubleſom pilgrimage muſt be ſweetned with ſongs of praiſes to him who crowns our prickles with roſes ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 65.11.</note> and plants
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95688:22"/>our low Vallies with fragrant mirtles, and at length will beautifie our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing temples with Diadems of joy and glory;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25 10.</note> 
                  <hi>For all his ways are like a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, full of mercy and truth, to ſuch as keep his Commandments and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude: Such is the divine grace, that the bittereſt potions of this life are given to prevent the deadly draught of nhe <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake of Hell. Nay, in this day how many of the Saints afflictions have been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and preparatives for greater mercys. Patient <hi>Joſeph</hi> firſt dragged his irons in priſon before he was drawn in <hi>Pharao</hi>'s ſecond Chariot, and adorned with chains of Gold.</p>
               <p>The ſtrongeſt ſtormes often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the moſt ſunſhine calms, and when winds blow higheſt they ſcatter the thick Clouds with greater vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. The darkeſt calamity of the Church uſhers in the moſt glorious times. It was ſo in <hi>Egypt, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> and after (the <hi>Decumanus fluctus</hi>) the tenth perſecution roſe up famous <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſo it ſhall be again. The laſt ſtroke of Papal ſury

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95688:24"/>2. Sudden mercies in plunges of diſtreſs. When the Church hath dream't of nothing but drinking the Wine of aſtoniſhment, yet awakned at the brink of ſtreams in the South. How have the Saints been ſupported,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 126.4.</note> ſuſtained, enlightned? How have doors opened on a ſudden, and Iron ſhackles been ſtruck of by Angels, and Jaylors bathed with their tears the prints of their own ſtripes? How have the oars ſtruck light in a dark tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and the Ships we ſail in ploughed up ſparkles from the briny billows of the Ocean in a ſtormy night, there being a native fire in ſalt, from which the rapid motion, hath extracted light? Affliction it ſelf hath taught a way to the haven of deliverance. Nay uſually, when we begin to be willing and humble and patient, to ſet down by the affliction, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Gods gracious dealings in the depths of correction, to erect us into ſome thankful, cheerful, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts, that it is not worſe, that thouſands drink of more bitter cups, and all out of hell is ſtupendious mercy. Many times the wind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95688:25"/>favour blows from a freſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and our feet are ſet upon the rock that is higher then us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. New and various mercies. God ſeldom delivers in the ſame methods. There was never the ſame face of Heaven from the Creation to this day. The aſpects, clouds, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do always vary, as the ſhells on the Sea-ſhore, and the pebble-ſtones, none exactly alike. No veins on the handback, no lines in the palm, no features in the millions of faces, no voices from the windpipe, no gate in the poſtures of walking, but if curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved do differ to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No temptations, no graces, no afflictions, and no deliverances are fully conformed to an union. We have new ſongs for every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had we hearts to tune them. When Gods wiſdom takes one mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy away, his beneficent bounty ſends another. When ſome ſetting Stars dip their flaming rays in the Weſtern Ocean, new ones glitter in the Eaſt. Never did the ſame water bubble from the ſame fountain: but as God is the inhexhauſtible ſpring of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95688:25"/>new and amiable Mercies: So we find he adorns the Out-rooms of the World, and the Chambers of the Tabernacle of his Church, with the Diaper and Tapeſtry-hangings of the curious Needlework of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

The ſtately River <hi>Nile</hi> riſes from a latent head, and the foundations of Famous Cities are under ground.

Many may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly profit us, we then owe not the benefit to them, but the great Incliner, the Soveraign Mover of Hearts. Let us not trouble our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits about that queſtion, <hi>Quo animo?</hi> with what deſign their Favours are calculated to our uſe. Ignoble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may perform ſome noble Actions upon a ſuperſtitious or vainglorious aim; as to merit Heaven, to gain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95688:28"/>to reſtrain the barkings of Conſcience, to ſtop the Mouth of Reprovers, and to oblige men to their humours, or ſome baſe intrigue or other. Of all perſons, Miniſters ſhould be moſt ſagacious, and the Seers of the Temple muſt be blind in ſuch Emergencies. When ſordid tempers exact difficult Secrecies for a little pelf, while themſelves ſpend ten times more on a baſe luſt; like thoſe that fat their Horſes for a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or their Slaves at <hi>Algier</hi> for to ſell in the Market at a higher Price: <hi>Homines vaenalis animae,</hi> that buy and ſell their ſouls for advantage, and are meer Merchants of all the Benefits they exert to others. Some Mens Favours are like Chryſtal Glaſſes, of a curious frailty, every. Spider of ſuſpicion cracks them. He that ponders too much upon the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican return of his benefits, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the trade of gain and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not his Conſcience to God, or the genuine good of others. There be many that take a pride to be counted liberal, when they let fall a few drops of charity upon famiſhed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95688:29"/>poverty, and love that the Sun ſhould ſhine upon their forward bounty, and make their Cock crow at the ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a few Corns from their lofty Dunghills; that can empty their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Stomachs into <hi>China,</hi> Diſhes, and hang Jewels and Pearls, the price of whole Cities, upon their Ears; and veſt themſelves with the Tribute of large Territories, and make as great a noiſe in ſcattering their Offals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Poor, as when the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Emperor blows his Trumpet after Dinner; and all the World muſt know when they give that which their high-fed Lap-curs many times refuſe. They'le wear Silk Garments like the <hi>Roman</hi> Matrons, of ſuch a fine Web, that neither their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are defended from weather, nor their Chaſtity from obſervation. but think much of a few Rags to cover a poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the Door. God gives them Hundreds by the Year, and they carry ſingle Pence in their Pockets, or braſs Farthings, to buy off the Clamours of Conſcience. But yet ſuch as are inward Enemies to true Evangelical Charity, ſhall be

               <p>I ſhall begin with the Firſt, and treat it as the Subject of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what an excellent Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is kindled by the ſenſe of Mercies.</p>
               <p>The moſt noble and generous love is that which ſtreams from Heaven, to ingratiate the hearts of Enemies by Springs of munificence, to ſweeten the tarteſt and ſowreſt tempers; to break Flints upon Pillows, to melt adamantine hearts in the warm blood of affection, to lead Lyons in Chains of Gold, and tame <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into Doves. Maſculine and Heroick Love changes the frame, and alters the conſtitution and tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hoſtile Hearts. Suſpicion,<note place="margin">Suſpicions.</note> which is the very Bane and Poyſon of Love, is by this Art fermented into a brisk, volatile, and balſamick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. To ſtand upon the Guard and watch, to eye and try, is but a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine and childiſh trifling; to ſubdue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95688:31"/>others by kindneſs, is God-like; to melt the Rocks of <hi>Caucaſus</hi> by flames from Heaven. Weak and low-ſtatur'd Love inſiſts upon the catch, and ſo becomes touchy and waſpiſh, puts forth its captious ſting at every buzz of falſe Flatterers and Backbiters: Noble Love is like the Ointment of the right hand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pr.</hi> 27.16.</note> which bewrays it ſelf; like a ſoft River of Oyl that runs down ſpeedily in a direct Chanel of inclination into the Ocean of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He that can command his Love when attracted by the Magnetick Influence of genuine Friendſhip, has but little true love under his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Suſpicion and Diſtruſt grows upon the Root of a weak Love: Generous and Noble Spirits had rather be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived than diſtruſt. True Love is not eaſily provoked and thinks no evil;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5.</note> it beareth, believeth, hopeth, and endureth all things. To lay heavy load, upon ſudden conjectures, is to tread upon quick ſands, and walk among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bogs. Such a Friend did not ſo courteouſly ſalute me in the ſtreet, did not invite me
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95688:31"/>among others, brake off his ſpeech abruptly, lookt not ſo pleaſantly, and turn'd ſuddenly out of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>Suſpicion blinds the underſtanding, and is a Cloud that an evil temper turn'd upon the Sun of affection. It caſt <hi>Eve</hi> out of Paradiſe, and leads fretful perſons into deſarts full of Bryars and Thorns: It miſchieves the owner, and preſents to himſelf a Cup, to drink up his own Poyſon.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.22.</note> That Perſon is held with the cords of ſin, and may complain with <hi>Eve, The Serpent within hath deceived me.</hi> When Men can out-wit the Devil in Policy, and be too ſtrong for Divine Juſtice, then they may walk in the ſhades of this Fools Paradiſe. Men never gain by the ill bargain of Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, but at laſt their very thoughts will upbraid them with weakneſs and folly. Deaw not long Arguments from the ſlender twine-thread of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion: We need a Dove-like ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and a benign eſtimate of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Accident. Words miſplac'd muſt not hurry our raw conjectures into Paſſions. It's the ſign of an evil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95688:32"/>to conſtrue the worſt, when a fair Gloſs may be more ſweetly, truly, and decently given. Believe nothing but what's manifeſt; uſe both your ears and your heart too, before you whet your tongue; and when ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions once appear to be vain, chide your too frequent credulity. Be not haſty to conceive an injury, leſt you bring forth a lye; the frequency of ſelf-rebuke through experience will pare away ſudden reflections. Let not little touches and ſmall ſcratches ſet you in a flame of anger. Becauſe your drink is not warm enough, or your ſervant ſlow, or the Table tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a little at Meat, or the Door is not preſently ſhut, to be in a ſcurvy Feaver of wrath, betrays dirty blood and ſordid ſpirits within. Becauſe a Flea or a Fly troubles you, or a pot falls, or a pipkin boyls over, or a glaſs broken, or children make a noiſe, or a thing is miſplac'd, or ancient people cough, or (as <hi>Myndyrides</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the roſes in his bed were a little doubled, to be in a rage; ſhews a proud, weak, and effeminate Spirit, deſerves the rebukes of ſilence, on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95688:32"/>deſerting their company as unfit for humane converſe. Some perſons have Souls good for little but to ſalt their bodies, and exerciſe the graces of others, and are alive by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for increaſe of wiſdom, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and pardoning mercy in their Alliances: Like Vermine ſubtile to do miſchief, and whet mens fancies to deviſe traps and gins to catch them; ſpend their days in trifles to ſpin pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Webs, catch Flies, and ſpit their Venom.</p>
               <p>Let's turn our eyes from miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deplorable forlorn Creatures, to him whoſe Throne is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and counts it a condeſcending humility to behold the Angels.<note place="margin">

               <p>FOR the Higher Advancement of Divine Goodneſs in all our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to learn that excellent Leſſon of Godly Contentment in all Eſtates, it were expedient to peruſe, conſider, and unbowel every mercy that comes down from Heaven. We have little reaſon to expect any when we remember our inability to merit, unskilfulneſs to improve, our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in ſlender returns of the leaſt Benefits wherewith we are laden eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. It's meer free grace that ſhowers down Kindneſſes upon our barren, murmuring, and repining Spirits.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95688:57"/>of the Flowry Medows inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with Chryſtal ſtreams, and the gentle riſing Hills crowned with lovely Groves, more delicious than thoſe of <hi>Woodſtock?</hi> when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the various numbers, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious methods, amazing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the unexpected ends, and ſurprizing deſigns in the Lawnes and cloſe Walks of Mercy. When we pore upon ſins, pry too curiouſly into afflictions, grieve too ſmartly for imbitterments by Relations, and toyle our Spirits with the loſſes and croſſes of this Life; we diſquiet our ſelves in vaine, and are too ſubject to mutter at every little diſappointment and inconvenience. We augment our troubles, prolong our miſeries, and run upon the brink of danger to charge a Gracious God fooliſhly.

               <p>HOW brittle and uncertain is the State of all things? nothing under the Sun that's conſtant and permanent. What various Events confound the Counſels of the deepeſt Politicians, every Age demonſtrates. Confidence of future proſperity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man ſtands upon the Pinacle of honour, is a token of the extremity of Folly. Between the higheſt fortune and the darkeſt Gulf of miſery, a day ſometimes does not intervene.<note place="margin">Dan. <hi>5.30. Xenoph.</hi> Cyrodad. l. <hi>7.</hi>

Phyſicians obſerve, That perſons in the height of health are often nigheſt to ſome dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and need preventing Phyſick; while ſuch as are in a recovering ſtate are a great deal ſafer. When the Sun is in his Meridian Glory, then he begins to decline, and after the darkeſt time of night the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star begins to glitter out of the Eaſt. Sudden viciſſitudes ought to render men cautious, and let the proudeſt <hi>Nimrods</hi> take heed of being imperious. When Gales are very benign to the Sail, yet the Keel of a Ship may be near ſharp Rocks and ſwallowing Quick-ſands.</p>
               <p>What's matter of caution in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, ſhould be comfort in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. <hi>Qui jacet in fovea non habet unde cadat,</hi> One faln to the ground has no further to fall; his next turn is to riſe.

               <p>Let's conclude this Chapter with a Memorable Story of Mr. <hi>Leverton</hi>'s Eſcapes in his <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Voyages, contracted out of the Manuſcript of my good Friend Mr. <hi>Ch. Morton,</hi> which thirſts for light; to ſhew what wonderful methods God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſes in bringing out of deep and amazing diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman putting to Sea from the Iſle of Sr. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> in a <hi>French</hi> Frigat commanded by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Voe</hi> of <hi>Rochel,</hi> after a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights ſail fell under a dead calm in the vaſt <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean. Victuals being almoſt ſpent, they ſtinted each perſon to 8 Spoonfuls of Peaſe and one pint of Water in a day; till at laſt they grew black with famine, and their Backs and Bellies ſhrunk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95688:85"/>Twice a day he prayed with and fed them with Spiritual Food; they hung upon his Lips with greedy attention. They had much Manna though no Corn, and ſtreams of Hony though little Water. The <hi>French,</hi> though Papiſts, expreſt their affections with briny Tears, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their famiſh'd Trunks with loud cries [<hi>Mon Dicu, mon Dicu;</hi> My God, My God.] Cleanneſs of Teeth ſharpned their Appetites to the Bread of Life. At length they kept a Solemn day of Prayer, when every day was a continual Faſt. Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a Lad from the Topmaſt-head deſcried a Veſſel, and Heaven ſent a benign Gale, which ſoon brought them together: She proved a <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas</hi> Merchant to their exceſſive joy, which took in Mr. <hi>Leverton</hi> with his Engliſh, ſupplyed the <hi>Rochellers</hi> wants, and ſo they parted.</p>
               <p>Upon conference, the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Ship being the Governour of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> tells Mr. <hi>Leverton</hi> that that their Ship came newly from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and at her arrival fell in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Rocks. To get her off
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95688:86"/>they took out their Guns and heavy Wares. The next Tide riſes with a violent Storm, while moſt of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were aſhore, and hurries them among the liquid Flouds, where the <hi>French</hi> found them, on purpoſe to bring deliverance at the end of prayer. After that, a fair Gale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts them ſafely to <hi>Bermudas;</hi> where they who had embraced the Throne of Grace in their abſence with Holy Hands, now embrace their Friends with happy Arms, and entertain them joyfully, who had been both carried out and brought in by Prayer.</p>
               <p>Here we have a <hi>French</hi> Calm at Sea, awakened into a Breeze for a Haven Enjoyment; and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Calm in Haven rouzed into a Storm for Sea-adventures, and both excited by Prayer. The <hi>French</hi> have a ſtorm within the Ship, though a calm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a ſtorm without, to bring to the former a calm within. O the vehement power of Prayer that raiſes ſtorms &amp; quells the boyſterous Waves at pleaſure! Here's a Ship full of Proviſion hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

               <p>AS that Perſon in <hi>Biſſeter</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, who having a piece of Bread in his Mouth, and turning ſuddenly to anſwer a queſtion while the Bread was ſwallowing, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately choack'd; and though he ſurvived about two or three days, yet no remedy prevailed.</p>
               <p>Remarkable was that providence of a poor Taylor at <hi>Reading</hi> choak'd with a bit of Mutton, having wiſh'd it to himſelf as he was eating, if he had ſtoln the Stockings whereof he was accuſed: Which ſtory is ſet down in the Regiſter of one of the Pariſhes of that Town.</p>
               <p>A ſudden accident alſo beſell Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> endeavouring to crack a Plum-ſtone, (as I am informed) brake a Tooth, and thereby loſt his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:95688:107"/>I would not let paſs two or three ſtories more of ſignal providences as to ſudden accidents.</p>
               <p>There lived ſome time ſince in <hi>Graſſechurch-street LONDON,</hi> a Vintner Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> by name, who playing with his little Child abed received a ſcratch of a Pin: Firſt it rankled and coſt him a Hundred Pounds-under deſign of cure; but at length his Arm was cut off, and ſhortly after loſt his life.</p>
               <p>There hapned alſo a notable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of Divine providence upon a Child in <hi>Biſhops-gate</hi> Pariſh (where ſometime the good hand of God was pleaſed to uſe my poor labours in the honourable ſervice of the Miniſtry:) This little Child looking up through a wooden caſe to a ponderous Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight; in that very moment the Weight drop'd down and kill'd it.</p>
               <p>I have alſo received intelligence of a Perſon worthy of credit, that a Woman having a very fair Hand moleſted by a Wart, and ſubmitting to the skill of a Chirurgeon at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Hoſpital in <hi>Southwark</hi> in order

               <p>To end with a comfortable ſtory: My good Friend Mr. <hi>Ch. Morton</hi> then at Sea, and yielding to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Ship-Chirurgeon to lay the <hi>Lapis Infernalis</hi> to eat down a Wart; his Arm ſwelled very dangerouſly, but the Lord delivered him. So true is that ſaying of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> That the greateſt Wounds may iſſue proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and little Scratches may end diſaſtrouſly; ſince the Keys of Life and Death are in the Hand of God.</p>
